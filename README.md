- The market is dominated by **small projects** → opportunity for large-scale developments.  
- Most projects are positioned in the **High-End segment** → opportunity exists in Mid-Market and Budget housing.

- Prices vary widely, with some projects significantly above market average → may indicate overpriced areas.
